# CWRGenerator
A project to generate CWR files for testing purposes.

The code for this project is almost entirely generated from iterations of ChatGPT requests.  
At some point I will log the conversation with ChatGPT so a clear history of iterations and prompts used can be reviewed if anyone is interested.
I am not a C# developer, but I wanted to see if I could use ChatGPT to develop a testing tool that I have been wanting at work.

This program will generate a file that conforms to CWR specifications found here:
